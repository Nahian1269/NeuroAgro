# **App Name**: NeuroAgro Insights

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Sensor Dashboard: Display real-time data from pH, gas, light, motion, raindrop, soil moisture, humidity, and temperature sensors.
- Sensor Data Analysis: Provide analysis results based on sensor data, identifying potential issues and recommendations for farming.
- Farming Analyzer: Analyze field size, width, geolocation, and sunlight data to determine the suitability of a location for vertical vs. traditional farming.
- Cost Analysis: If a location is better for traditional farming, analyze and present the potential cost for vertical farming in that specific location.
- Disease Detection: Allow users to upload images and use a trained machine learning model (tool) to detect plant diseases.
- Alerting and Notifications: Configure alerts based on sensor readings or analysis results (e.g., low soil moisture, disease detection).

## Style Guidelines:
